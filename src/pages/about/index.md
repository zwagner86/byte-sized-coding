Hey, my name is Zach.  I am a software engineer with full-stack experience but a passion for working in the front-end.  I am starting this blog as a place to jot down things I've learned with the hope that others might be able to find it useful.  If you'd like to know more about me, you can visit my personal site <a href="https://www.zacharywagner.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

Thanks for stopping by!
